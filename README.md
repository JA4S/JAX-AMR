# JAX-AMR

JAX-AMR is a JAX-based adaptive mesh refinement framework, which can totally support the JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation (jax.jit).

## State of the Project

- [x] 2D AMR, fully jit-compiled ✅
- [x] conjuction with the CFD solver ✅
- [ ] 3D AMR (soon)
- [ ] Immerse boudary method (soon)
- [ ] parallel mannagment (soon)
